Job Application Portal - AK Group of Companies
üìå Project Overview
This is a full-stack job application portal designed to streamline the process of collecting and managing applicant data for the AK Group of Companies. It features a user-friendly React frontend where applicants can submit their details. The submissions are then stored in a PostgreSQL database and simultaneously sent via email to the administration for immediate visibility.

The backend is built with Express.js and deployed on Railway, while the responsive frontend is hosted on Netlify, creating a robust and scalable MERN-like stack (PostgreSQL instead of MongoDB).

üöÄ Live Demo
Frontend (Netlify): https://my-job-application-site.netlify.app/

üéØ Key Features
Clean & Responsive UI: Modern interface built with React and Tailwind CSS.

Instant Email Notifications: Sends applicant details directly to an admin email using EmailJS.

Persistent Data Storage: Securely stores all application data in a PostgreSQL database.

Resume Collection: Allows users to submit their resumes (currently stores the file name).

Seamless User Experience: Automatically redirects users to a welcome page after successful submission.

Scalable Architecture: Easily extendable to support full cloud file uploads (e.g., S3, Cloudinary).

üìÑ Pages Developed
Landing Page (/)

Displays a welcome message: "Welcome to AK Group of companies!!!"

Serves as the introductory page and the destination after form submission.

Home Page / Application Form (/apply)

A comprehensive form for applicants to fill in their details.

Form Fields: Name, Email, Contact Number, Qualification, Current Organization, Notice Period, Skills, and a Resume Upload button.

üì§ Form Submission Flow
A user navigates to the application form and fills in all the required fields.

Upon clicking "Submit," two actions are triggered simultaneously:

Email Notification: An email is sent via EmailJS to a pre-configured admin address, containing the applicant's details and the submission timestamp.

Data Persistence: A POST request is sent to the backend API. The Express server processes the data and inserts it into the applicants table in the PostgreSQL database.

The user is shown a "Thank You" message for confirmation.

The user is then automatically redirected back to the landing page.

üåê Backend API Endpoint
The Express.js backend exposes the following endpoint:

POST /api/applicants

Description: Receives applicant data from the frontend form and stores it in the PostgreSQL database.

Request Body:

{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "contact": "1234567890",
  "qualification": "M.Sc. Computer Science",
  "organization": "Tech Corp",
  "notice": "2 Months",
  "skills": "React, Node.js, PostgreSQL",
  "resume_link": "JohnDoe_Resume.pdf"
}

Success Response: 201 Created with a success message.

Error Response: 500 Internal Server Error with an error message.
